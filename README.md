## 📘 About the Project

Millions of people around the world are affected by diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disease that requires early and accurate classification for effective management. This project explores the use of diverse machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for classifying diabetes using health indicators from the BRFSS 2015 dataset.

The objective is to compare and evaluate a variety of ML and DL algorithms—including ensemble techniques, neural networks, and hybrid models—to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability. Each team member contributed models ranging from traditional classifiers (like logistic regression and decision trees) to advanced methods (such as conditional GANs and convolutional neural networks).

Key aspects of the project include:

* Preprocessing and handling imbalanced data
* Model training using ensemble and deep learning techniques
* Performance evaluation and comparison
* Exploring model interpretability for explainable AI (XAI)

This work draws on recent research that highlights the effectiveness of hybrid models and deep learning in medical diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of data quality, feature selection, and advanced modeling frameworks in improving diabetes classification systems.
